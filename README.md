# TradeStars Platform

## Project Description 

The Trade Stars system will manage the process of searching and booking trade services in your area through an online portal. Customers are able to create an 
account, login to the system, and search available services. They also have the ability to schedule an appointment with the company, see reviews about the
 company and write their own review for others to see. Tradesmen are able to create an account with an associated company and service, and login to that 
company through their credentials. From there a tradesman can view appointment requests, and approve or reject these requests. They can also view their 
schedule, cancel or complete appointments and finally view reviews made about their services by their customers.

## Features 

1. The landing page will allow the user to login to their existing account or create a new account. The user will be able to create a Tradesman
account or a customer account. 
2. Once registered or logged in, the user will be prompted to the appropriate dashboard (Tradesman dashboard or Customer dashboard)
3. The customers will be able to view key information on the sidenav. These information include the ability to view their account information,
their upcoming appointments, and the services being offered on the platform.
4. Clicking on the "View Service" button, the customer will be able to view the list of services being offered on the platform. For each 
service, the customer will be able to read reviews about that service, book an appointment with that service, or give a review on that service.
5. If logged in as a tradesman through the landing page, the tradesman will be able to approve/ reject appointments, view their schedule, and 
read reviews made about them.
6. Through the view schedule button, the tradesman can mark the appointment as complete so the system knows that the appointment is taken care of.
7. Through the approve/ reject button, the tradesman can approve the appointment which would make the appointment then show up on the schedule.
If the tradesman decided to mark the appointment as rejected, that specific appointment will not show up on the tradesman's schedule or on the 
customer's schedule.
8. Both the customer and the tradesman are able to logout of the platform which would redirect them to the landing page.
